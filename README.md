# MIPS-Based-4x16-bit-Single-Cycle-Processor
Designing a Single Cycle MIPS Base Processor With Logisim
As a refrence i use Commputer Arcitecture and Organization: Hardware Software Interface
I think the most important part of the book for these designs are the appendixes (especially A and D(if your version of the book doesn't have this search for it online you can find it))
There are some changes that you can add 
  1-adding nor and nand operation 
  2-removing the adder in reg-file 
  3-optimizing the way jumps work
I Seriously recommend having at least a basic knowledge of computer architecture and don't copy and paste this
I hope this will of help to you guys.
